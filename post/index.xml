      <description>Synopsis This post aims to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events focusing on their economic and health impact. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&amp;rsquo;s (NOAA) storm database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage. The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011.</description>

      <description>This is just a list of git commands I am currently using. I will keep on adding stuff to it as I use more/different commands. There are tons of tutorials out there as well as quite a few cheat sheets. While those are mostly comprehensive resources, I tend to get distracted and try to learn all commands at once without using them in real projects. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t help much.</description>
