      <description>Everything Varies Mean - One Measure of Centeral Tendency   Imagine you were in the market for a new car. You care about running cost of the car and thus one of the buying criteria you have in mind is better fuel economy. One of your friends suggests to buy a 4-cylinder car instead of 6or 8 cylinders since larger engine size ususally translates to worse fuel economy. You are a data scientist so you just donâ€™t take his word but want to look at some concrete data before you narrow down your search to 4-cylinder vehicles.</description>

      <description>Functions Validating Function Inputs using Conditionals Repeating a Calculation Many Times Passing Arguments to a Function used inside User-Defined Function Peeking into a Function Where do these Functions and Objects live? Loading Objects in R Environment from R Scripts How Fast (or Slow) my Code Runs? Quick Introduction to Tibbles (and Dataframes) Exploring Built-In Datasets Extracting Atomic Vectors from a Tibble Where am I? Summary   In an earlier post we learned a key ingredient needed for creating any data product - atomic vectors.</description>

      <description>Creating Our First Atomic Vector Peeking into our Vector Objects as Arguments to Functions Other Ways of Creating a Vector Vector Operations Chaining of Functions Selecting Few Elements of a Vector (Subsetting) More Uses of Logical Subsetting Two Types of Vectors Pick Elements Randomly Some Special Values Sequences for Loops Creating an empty vector Some Useful Vector Transformations Comparing Two Vectors Third Type of Atomic Vector Sorting Character Vectors and Changing Case Pattern Matching in Character Vectors using Regular Expressions Stringr Tools Factors - an Augmented Vector Type Summary   Atomic vectors in R are the fundamental data structures on which other more complex data structures are built.</description>
