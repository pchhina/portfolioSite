      <description>In an earlier post, we learned a little bit about inference and some interesting tools that we can employ to make informed decisions based on our data instead of just guessing. Next you show your analysis to your friend who suggested to look for small engine cars to get better fuel economy. He is extremely impressed by the power of statistics and asks you another question.
 Can we use the data we have to predict the fuel economy of any car from that population that we want?</description>

      <description>Functions Validating Function Inputs using Conditionals Repeating a Calculation Many Times Passing Arguments to a Function used inside User-Defined Function Peeking into a Function Where do these Functions and Objects live? Loading Objects in R Environment from R Scripts How Fast (or Slow) my Code Runs? Quick Introduction to Tibbles (and Dataframes) Exploring Built-In Datasets Extracting Atomic Vectors from a Tibble Where am I? Summary   In an earlier post we learned a key ingredient needed for creating any data product - atomic vectors.</description>
