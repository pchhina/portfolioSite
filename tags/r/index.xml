      <title>Persistent Plotting in R</title>

      <description>In this post, I describe the importance of persistent plots while carrying out a analysis. A case is made for simpler and persistent plots and the process to create the plots is demonstrated with an example. Finally, a package is created to stitch things together in a coherent fashion.
With the amount of available options in R today to create plots, it is easy to get distracted and miss the point of using plots in first place - to bring to attention something unique about the data which otherwise could be difficult, if not impossible, just looking at the raw numbers.</description>

      <title>Building R Package using Command Line</title>

      <description>This post describes the process of building an R package without using RStudio. This can come in handy for anyone who is using vim (and of course Nvim-R!) as a code editor for their development work. Alright, let’s get moving. We are going to create a small package offering a new ggplot theme to demonstrate the process.
Step 0: Install the required packages
install.packages(c(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;roxygen2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;testthat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;knitr&amp;quot;)) library(devtools) has_devel() The command has_devel() basically checks that everything is installed as expected.</description>

      <title>Creating a New ggplot2 Theme</title>

      <description>This post introduces simple steps on how to create your own ggplot2 theme. Of course, it will not go into details of changing all the aspects. Instead, it will highlight the process using few useful elements.
Theme is basically a set of pre-defined(default) values for elements that make up a plot in ggplot2 library. Major elements are:
 Plot, the outermost area used by a plot. Think of this as let’s say your A4 sheet on which you want to draw a plot.</description>

      <title>Exercise Quality Prediction using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>Many devices exist today in the market (such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit) that inexpensively record, track and analyze data on personal physical activity. Although by using these devices, quantiy of the physical activity is often monitored, quality is rarely quantified. In this project, our goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants in an attempt to predict whether the activity is performed correcly or not.</description>

      <title>Economic and Health Impact of Severe Weather Events</title>
      <link>https://paramjot.io/post/stormdata/</link>

      <description>This post aims to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events focusing on their economic and health impact. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&amp;rsquo;s (NOAA) storm database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage. The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011.</description>

      <title>US Wind Energy Production (2016)</title>

      <description>Last week I learned while listening to NPR that Texas is at the top when it comes to wind power production among all US states. While it is a suprising fact given that Texas is a conservative state and the article is an interesting read in itself, this led me to pull some data from US Department of Energy and create the map I have presented here.</description>
